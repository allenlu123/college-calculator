<p><center>The University of Washington is primarily located in Seattle, Washington, but it also has locations in Bothell and Tacoma. Despite the urban setting, UW’s 703 acre campus is one of the best ranked in the nation. In the springtime, the entire campus becomes covered with a cloudy layer of cherry blossoms. UW has a quarter-based academic calendar, and its students receive a lot of flexibility over when they can start their terms. Because the majority of UW students come from the Seattle area, its known as a commuter school and freshmen aren’t required to live on campus. It has an 11:1 student faculty ratio. The UW Huskies are known for their long-time rivalry with the WSU Cougars (www.uwrejects.com). The top 5 majors are social sciences, biological and biomedical sciences, business management, engineering, and performing arts. Famous alumni include Bruce Lee, Brandon Roy, and Jermaine Kearse.</center></p>
